The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Fortune favors the bold.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Better late than never.
